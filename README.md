## Django Website
The client of this project was the AGED department of Egerton University. They had done some research and had gained a lot of data on their students, including names, email addresses, and phone numbers. They thus decided to database this information and I was contracted to do so. Instead of just storing it in a generic database I decided to develop this web app where they could view them, search them on multiple parameters and add new students with ease. The login system also allowed the lecturers in the department to have their own profiles which they can use individually from anywhere in the world. The user interface was extremely easy to use and was designed for anyone who is or is not computer savvy. You can see me teaching how I made it step by step on my [YouTube tutorial on how to create a Django website](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RO3IjgcEBI&list=PLjYn2orKlXaqLw3U8RecBtz-FMckbwb1y). The technology used was **Python** and its web framework **Django**. The code itself is [here](https://github.com/NgangaNgaruiya001/Adding-PostgreSQL-as-your-database).
